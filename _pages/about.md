# About Me

👩‍💻 I'm an incoming PhD student at Texas A&M University, [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html),  starting Fall 2024. I'll be fortunate to work at [Dream Lab](https://www.xiameng.org/DreamLab/), under the supervision of [Dr. Meng Xia](https://www.xiameng.org/). 

🔬 My research interests are mainly in Education Technology and Human Computer Interaction.

Previously, I graduated with a bachelor degree in Computer Engineering from Islamic Azad University, Yazd Branch.
